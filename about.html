    <h2>About Anime Vault</h2>

    <p>Anime Vault is a curated collection of anime titles I've watched, plan to watch, and personally recommend. Itâ€™s built as both a tracker and a digital library.</p>

    <h3>About the Creator</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>AIZACK</strong>...an anime lover with a passion for action-packed sagas, mind-bending thrillers, and heartwarming slice-of-life series. I built this vault to stay organized, share thoughts, and relive favorite moments.</p>

    <h3>What Youâ€™ll Find Here</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trending Anime</strong> â€“ Top picks that are currently hot in the anime world.</li>
      <li><strong>Watchlist</strong> â€“ Shows Iâ€™m currently watching or plan to binge next.</li>
      <li><strong>Reviews</strong> â€“ Quick takes and opinions on anime Iâ€™ve finished.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Purpose of the Vault</h3>
    <p>Anime Vault isnâ€™t just a list â€” it's a passion project. It serves as a hub to revisit favorite series, discover overlooked gems, and hopefully connect with others who share the same love for anime storytelling.</p>

    <h3>ðŸ’¬ Got Suggestions?</h3>
    <p>While this is a solo project, Iâ€™m always up for expanding it. If you think there's an anime I should check out, <em>drop a comment or connect!</em></p>
